# Smart Pointers

- Standard references borrow data with no overhead.
- Smart pointers act as a reference type with additonal capabilities, eg owning their data.
- Very common examples:
  - `String`
  - `Vec<T>`
- Smart pointers are implemented using structs.
  - `Deref` and `Drop` traits allow a type to be a smart pointer.
  - `Deref` allows us to use smart pointers where we use references.
  - `Drop` allows us to customize the code that is run when the smart pointer goes out of scope.
- Well known: 
  - `Box<T>`: for allocating values on the heap.
  - `Rc<T>`: a reference counted type that enables multiple ownership.
  - `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>`, access through `RefCell<T>`, a type that enforces borrowing rules at runtime. 

## `Box<T>`

> `Box<T>` points to data on the heap and has a known size.

- No performance overhead outside of heap access vs stack access.
- Must used when:
  - A type's size cannot be known at compile time.
  - You have a large amount of data to transfer ownership and you don't want to copy it when you do so.
  - You want to own a value and only care that it's a type that implements a trait rather than knowing it's concrete type (basically your traditional oop interface).

### Using `Box<T>` to Store Data on the Heap

```rust
// Store a primitive on the heap by boxing it.
fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b = {}", b);
}
```

- When the box goes out of scope both it and the data it owns is dropped.

### Boxes Enable Recursive Types

At compile time, Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up.

An example of a type that doesn't have a known size at compile time is a _recursive type_, where a value can have part of itself another value of the same type.

Error demonstrated for recursive types:

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, List),
    Nil,
}

// error: recursive type `List` has infinite size.
fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));
}
```

Use indirection (in this case with a Box) to solve:

```rust 
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

// Woohoo no error!
fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1,
    	Box::new(Cons(2,
    		Box::new(Cons, 3)
    			Box::new(Nil))));
}
```

## Treating Smart Poitners Like Regular References with the `Deref` Trait

- Implementing the `Deref` trait allows us to customize the behaviour of the _dereference operator_, `*`. 

```rust
// Tuple struct just holds the value.
struct MyBox<T>(T); 

impl<T> MyBox<T> {
    fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
        MyBox(x)
    }
}

impl<T> ::std::ops::Deref for MyBox<T> {
	type Target = T;
    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
		&self.0
    }
}

fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&m);
    // The smart pointer gets deref coerced into a &str.
    // &MyBox<String> => &String => &str.
}

fn hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}", name);
}
```

### Deref and Mutability

- From `&T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`
- From `&mut T` to `&mut U` when `T: DerefMut<Target=U>`
- From `&mut T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`

## The `Drop` Trait Runs Code on Cleanup

- Cusomize what happens when an object goes out of scope.
- We can use it to release resources such as files or network connections.
- `Drop` is almost always implemented on smart pointers.

```rust
struct CustomSmartPointer {
    data: String,
}

impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
    fn drop(&self) {
        println!("Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`!", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("Jack"),
    };
    let d = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("Mordaunt"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointers created");
}
```

## `Rc<T>`: Share Data Immutably

> `Rc<T>` is a reference counting smart pointer.

- Allow multiple immutable borrows of one piece of data at the same time.
- Only for single threaded contexts.

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

enum List {
    Cons(Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

// a, b and c all share data through Rc<T>.
// When you clone an Rc it bumps the reference counter.
// When an Rc is dropped it decrements the reference counter.
fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5,
    	Rc::new(Cons(10,
    		Rc::new(Nil)))));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    {
        let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
    }
}
```

- You could call `Rc.clone()`, but the idiomatic way is `Rc::clone(..)` with the associated function.

## `RefCell`: Share Data Immutably

_Interior mutability_ is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data. 

This uses `unsafe` code inside a data structure to bend the rules.

> We can use types that use interior mutability when we can ensure that the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the compiler can't guarantee that.  The `unsafe` code is then wrapped in a safe API, and the outer type is still immutable.

### Enforcing Borrowing Rules at Runtime

- Since the Rust compiler is conservative there are some cases which validly follow the borrowing rules yet are rejected by the compiler because it can't understand.
- `RefCell<T>` allows us to implement these types of programs by adhering to the borrowing rules at runtime.
- If the code is actually incorrect and breaks the rules you will get a runtime panic. 
- Like `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>` is only for single threaded contexts.

#### Use Case: Mock Objects

**The problem:**

1. You want to implement a trait with a mock object.

2. The trait defines a method that _immutably_ borrows `self`

   - `fn foo(&self) {}`

3. You want to mutate the state of self inside this method despite no access to a mutable reference, while still conforming to the trait signature.

   - ```rust
     fn foo(&self) {
         // Eg: attempt to mutate a vector.
         self.list.push("can't do this, we don't have mutable reference which push requires");
     }
     ```

**The solution:**

1. Wrap the fields you desire to mutate in your mock with a `RefCell<T>` smart pointer.

2. Use `borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` to get references to the field.

   - ```rust
     fn foo(&self) {
     	self.list.borrow_mut().push("Yay this works! Provided list is not borrowed anywhere else at runtime")
     }
     ```

3. Breaking the borrow checker rules will give you a _runtime_ panic. 

   1. You can borrow only one mutable reference.
   2. You can borrow any number immutable references provided there are no borrowed mutable references.

   - ```rust
     // This code will compile despite the borrow checking error.
     // You will get a nice panic at runtime while attempting to
     // assign to variable d, since there are still active
     // immutable references.
     fn foo(&self) {
         {
             let a = self.list.borrow_mut();
         } // Dropped the mutable reference; so we're okay.
         let b = self.list.borrow();
         let c = self.list.borrow();
         {
             let d = self.list.borrow_mut(); // Panic!
         }
     }
     ```
